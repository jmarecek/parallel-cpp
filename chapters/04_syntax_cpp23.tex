\section{Threads, Tasks, Coroutines}

\subsection{C++11 thread}

C++11 had a very basic support for threads, in terms of \cpp{std::thread} of header \cpp{thread}. The thread starts running once the constructor is called. The object is not CopyConstructible nor CopyAssignable. 
The challenge in C++11 threads is that one needs to call \cpp{join} or \cpp{detach} prior to the destructor being called. If neither was called, the program was \cpp{std::abort}ed. 
Prior to calling either, one needs to check whether the thread is \cpp{joinable()}.
At the same time, it was almost impossible to handle exceptions while being able to call \cpp{join} correctly. 
%std::promise
The use of the C++11 \cpp{thread} is thus considered harmful and we will present only two short examples.

\end{codebox}

\subsection{C++20 jthread}

C++20 adds a new class \cpp{jthread} (``joining threads''), which does not require a call to \cpp{join} or \cpp{detach}. Instead, the destructor waits for completion of the code (``joins'') automatically. 

This is an example of the ``resource acquisition is initialization'' idiom, which is generally one of the best practices in C++. In RAII, the resource allocation is tied to an object's lifetime and is hence a class invariant. In a constructor, one allocates the resources. In a destructor, one releases the resources. There is no risk of a resource leak.

\end{codebox}

Notice that the above example would very like result in abnormal program termination, if we changed jthread to thread. (Why?) When we use standard output, it is prudent to wrap it in a syncstream:

\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/jthread2.cpp}
\end{codebox}

Rather commonly, one uses the lambda function to define the thread. (This is the \cpp{[]()}.)

\footnotesize An example of the use of jthread.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/jthread3.cpp}
\end{codebox}

Passing arguments to threads is, nevertheless, very useful. Notably, when we pass the first argument of type \cpp{std::stop_token token}, we request the thread to stop its execution by calling \cpp{request_stop()} on the jthread object:

\footnotesize An example of the use of jthread.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/jthread4.cpp}
\end{codebox}

More complicated procedures for the stopping of the thread possible. One can define \cpp{std::stop_callback} object inside the thread, whose constructor takes the stop token (\cpp{std::stop_token}) and a function. The function (in the example below another lambda) gets executed, when the thread is requested to stop via the \cpp{std::stop_token}:

%\subsection{Tasks}

\subsection{Coroutines}

In C++23 and subsequent versions, we hope to see some standard syntax for defining coroutines (cf. P2502), such as:

\raggedbottom
\begin{codebox}[]{}
\footnotesize An example of the use of coroutines, which currently does not compile in GCC 12.2.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/coroutines1.cpp}
\end{codebox}

Unfortunately, defining the coroutine in C++20 take some more effort. In particular, it requires:
\begin{itemize}
\item defining the behaviour of the coroutine, which is known as a \cpp{promise} (different from \cpp{std::promise}), and requires one returns the type used to access the state of the coroutine on the heap, which is known as the handle,  
\item defining how to store the state of the coroutine on the heap, using template class \cpp{std::coroutine_handle} parametrized by the promise
\end{itemize}
Clearly, one needs to declare one, define the other, and then return to declare the first one. We will see how to do this later.
Optionally, we can also define an awaiter, which controls suspension and resumption behaviour.

In terms of using the coroutine, there are three new keywords:
\begin{itemize}
\item \cpp{co_await awaiter} suspends computation and block the co-routine until the computation is resumed by another co-routine calling ``resume'' method of the present coroutine. In the process, it tests whether it is possible to suspend the computation using an awaiter such as \cpp{std::suspend_always{};} (or an awaitable object, more generally, as discussed below) and, if so, saves all local variables to a heap-allocated handle.
\item \cpp{co_yield} yields a value and suspends computation as above, and  
\item \cpp{co_return} returns a value. (There is no notion of an optional return type in-built.)
\begin{end}

A difficulty in using coroutines is the fact that the coroutine may live longer than the scope it has been called from. It is hence \emph{not} advisable to pass by reference, except perhaps \cpp{std::ref} or \cpp{std::cref}. One can either pass by value or pass, e.g., \cpp{std::unique_ptr}:

\raggedbottom
\begin{codebox}[]{}{}
\footnotesize An example of the use of coroutines, which currently does not compile in GCC 12.2.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/coroutines2.cpp}
\end{codebox}

Below, we will see two examples of the use of coroutines that compile with GCC 11 and 12, when you enable -std=c++2b -fcoroutines, but illustrate that the current use of the template class \cpp{std::coroutine_handle<promise>} is a bit unwieldy. 
First, we need to be able to define a promise class, which defines the behaviour of the coroutine by implementing methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \cpp{coroutine get_return_object()} is called to inialize the coroutine and create the coroutine handle, which can be the rather formulaic \cpp{coroutine_handle::from_promise(*this)};} 
\item \cpp{std::suspend_always initial_suspend()}, suggests whether the coroutine starts right after initialization (\cpp{std::suspend_never()} ) or upon resumption (\cpp{std::suspend_always()}). (Both awaiterers are described below.)
\item \cpp{std::suspend_always final_suspend() noexcept}, which can be rather formulaic \cpp{std::suspend_always()}
\item \cpp{void return_void()} or \cpp{void return_value(const auto& value)}, which is called upon reaching the end of the coroutine and upon reaching \cpp{co_return}. The latter (\cpp{return_value}) often just stores the result locally. 
\item \cpp{void unhandled_exception()}, which can be rather formulaic \cpp{std::terminate()}, or can save the exception via \cpp{std::current_exception()}.
\end{itemize}

The promise class is instantiated for each instance of the coroutine, and its methods are called as follows:

\raggedbottom
\begin{codebox}[]{}
\footnotesize A schema of the coroutine, in terms of its calls of the methods of the promise class.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/coroutines_schema.h}
\end{codebox}

Once we have a promise class, we can specialize template class \cpp{std::coroutine_handle}, which can be seen as the equivalent of a pointer and its method ``destroy'' as equivalent to a ``free'', and use the handle specialized to our own promise class to define a promise class:

\raggedbottom
\begin{codebox}[]{\href{https://godbolt.org/z/1nYdMPh3z}{\ExternalLink}}
\footnotesize An example of the use of coroutines.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/coroutines3.cpp}
\end{codebox}

Sometimes, we also store the promise type in a \cpp{promise_type} type member, and disable (\cpp{= delete}) copy and move constructors. 

\subsubsection{Awaiters}

Finally, let us consider awaiters, which can be called when a coroutine is suspended or resumed. 
Key methods of an awaiter include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \cpp{await_ready()} is called immediately before suspension of a coroutine. If it returns \cpp{true}, the coroutine will not be suspended. 
\item \cpp{await_suspend(handler)} is called immediately after the suspension of the coroutine. The \cpp{handler} of type \cpp{std::coroutine_handle} can be used to pass the state of the coroutine (e.g., to another thread). 
\item \cpp{await_resume()} is called when the coroutine is resumed after a successful suspension. If it returns a value, this will be returned by the \cpp{co_await} routine. 
\end{itemize}
The awaiters we have seen so far (\cpp{std::suspend_never()} and \cpp{std::suspend_always()}) returned boolean constants in \cpp{await_ready()}:

\raggedbottom

\footnotesize An example of two standard awaiters.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/awaiters1.h}
\end{codebox}

By defining \cpp{await_transform()} in the promise type, the compiler will use \cpp{co_await promise.await_transform(<expr>)} instead of any call of \cpp{co_await <expr>} in the coroutine.

Eventually, in C++23 and C++26, the support for message-passing architectures based on \url{https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro} should be available. For a small sample, see a custom implementation here:

\section{Synchronisation Primitives}

\subsection{Barrier}

Since C++20, there is support for barriers in header \cpp{<barrier>}. The constructor takes an integer value, which is the number of threads that the barrier is expected to block. The key methods are \cpp{arrive_and_wait()} and \cpp{arrive_and_drop()}. The former functions as one would expect. The latter decrements the initial expected count for all uses by one, as if one thread could never reach the barrier subsequently. This can be very useful in error management:

\footnotesize An example of the use of a barrier.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/barrier1.cpp}
\end{codebox}

More complicated uses of barriers may use the template parameter \cpp{CompletionFunction} and have a callable executed whenever the barrier is hit (reaches zero):

\footnotesize An example of the use of a barrier.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/barrier2.cpp}
\end{codebox}

\subsection{Atomic Variables}
\label{sec:atomiccpp23}

Since C++11, there is an excellent support for atomic variables in header \cpp{<atomic>}. 
The primary template can be instantiated with types that are TriviallyCopyable, CopyConstructible, and CopyAssignable.
First, let us consider two simple examples:

\raggedbottom
\begin{codebox}[]{\href{https://godbolt.org/z/}{\ExternalLink}}
\footnotesize An example of the use of atomic variables.

\footnotesize An example of the use of atomic variables.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/atomic2.cpp}
\end{codebox}

Finally, let us consider two, more complete examples of a stack:

\raggedbottom
\begin{codebox}[]{\href{https://godbolt.org/z/}{\ExternalLink}}
\footnotesize A stack implemented using atomic variables.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/atomic5.cpp}
\end{codebox}

We will elaborate upon this later in Chapter \ref{ch:datastructures}. 

\subsection{Mutexes}

A good practice for the use of mutexes is to lock them via the RAII idiom. Since C++11, this is available as \cpp{std::unique_lock} in header \cpp{<mutex>}:

\raggedbottom
\begin{codebox}[]{\href{https://godbolt.org/z/}{\ExternalLink}}
\footnotesize An example of the use of a barrier.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/mutex1.cpp}
\end{codebox}

A slightly more verbose example considers:

\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/mutex2.cpp}
\end{codebox}

\section{Algorithms in the Standard Template Library}

Since C++17, there is an excellent Parallel Standard Template Library in header \cpp{<algorithm>}.

\subsection{For Each}
\label{sec:foreachcpp23}

The most useful algorithm from the Standard Template Library (STL) in terms of parallel programming is surely for each:

\raggedbottom
\begin{codebox}[]{\href{https://godbolt.org/z/}{\ExternalLink}}
\footnotesize An example of the use of for each.
\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/for_each_code_parallel.h}
\end{codebox}

As in the serial version of STL, the callable within for each is permitted to change the state of elements, if the underlying range is mutable, but cannot invalidate iterators.

\subsection{Reduce}

Similarly useful is the reduce operation (also known as fold, accumulate, aggregate, compress, or inject). Indeed, a whole approach to parallel programming (Map Reduce) is named after the algorithm. There, one applies an associative operation to each piece of data to obtain a partial result, and then (perhaps using a binary-tree reduction, which also may enforce an order which may or may not be desirable) obtains the final result by applying the same associative operation to the partial results. The binary-tree reduction makes it possible to utilize $O(\log(n))$ rounds of computation on $n$ processors.

\tcblower
\cppfile{code_examples/cpp23/reduce_code.h}
\end{codebox}

\subsection{Merge}

Finally, in implementing parallel sorting algorithms, we will utilize the parallel merge operation:

\end{codebox}
